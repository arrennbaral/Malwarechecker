# Malwarechecker
Checks malware in the submitted file.

Requirement: A Server (I used MAMP for mysql connection)
The project allows the user to check if the file is Malware Free.
Admin uploads malware into the database to check the file with the users.
Admin needs to authenticate before uploading the malware with username and password.
Once the malware is uploaded, the user can upload the file in the malware.php and see if the file contains the malware. 
All of the user contents are very very carefully sanitized to prevent from unprecedented attacks. 
Also, the admin page is sanitized as well to prevent from unauthorized login attacks.
